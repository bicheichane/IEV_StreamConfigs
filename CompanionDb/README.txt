Set the environment variable 'COMPANION_CONFIG_BASEDIR' to this folder and restart your companion instance so it references the db's contained here
***


Since Companion 3.0, each release your config gets put into a new folder.
This makes it much easier and safer to downgrade to older releases, as their configuration will be left untouched.
When launching a version whose folder doesn't yet exist, the config will be copied from one of the previous releases, looking in release order.

The db file in this folder is used for 2.4 or older, use the appropriate folders for newer configs
